<h2>The API details</h2>

<a name="login"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/login API</h3>

<p>A user may login (and aquire a session) by making a POST request to /swapp/login. The POST should have no content, but only an authorization HTTP header stating a user id and a password. The exact format of this header is "Authorization: userid:password". </p> 
    
<p>A DELETE /swapp/login logs out the user.</p> 

<a name="users"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/admin/user API</h3>

<p>A user may register a new user by making a POST request to /swapp/admin/users with parameters 'user' and 'password'. Furthermore, the content of the request must be a Prolog term of the form [roles([...]), ...].</p>

<p>A registered user may be removed from the user database by making a DELETE request to /swapp/admin/users with parameter 'user'.</p>

<p>A GET retrieves the information about the user with a certain userid. If the user parameter is left blank, information about all users is returned. </p>

<a name="settings"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/admin/settings API</h3>

<p>A POST sets a setting given a valid combination of module and name of setting. The value of the setting should be provided as the content.</p> 

<p>A GET retrieves all settings for a given combination of module and setting. If the setting parameter is left blank, all settings for the given module are returned. If the module parameter is left blank as well, all settings for all modules are returned. </p>

<a name="statistics"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/admin/statistics API</h3>

<p>A GET retrieves all statistics for the running instance of SWAPP.</p>

<a name="rdfdb"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/rdf/db API</h3>

<p>A PUT or a POST adds triples to the RDF database. The only difference between the two is that a POST appends to the already existing database, whereas a PUT replaces the content of current RDF database altogether. Starting from an empty database, they have exactly the same effect.</p> 

<p>Triples added to the database are marked with it owner, which normally (if authorization is required) is the current user.</p>

<p>The DELETE operation takes a template parameter specifying the triples to be deleted from the RDF database. Each triple matching (in the sense of being unifiable with) a template of the form rdf(S, P, O) is deleted. The value of the template parameter may also be a <i>list</i> of templates and in that case triples matching any member of this list are deleted. If the template parameter is missing or empty, the whole RDF database is emptied.</p>

<p>Note that it follows that a PUT /swapp/rdf/db is equivalent to a DELETE /swapp/rdf/db followed by a POST /swapp/rdf/db. </p>

<p>A GET request takes four parameters: 1) one mandatory <code>query</code> parameter specifying the Prolog query that we wish to run, 2) an optional <code>cursor</code> specifying the solution that we are interested in (a nonnegative integer where 0 indicates the first solution, 1 the second solution, etc., and where 0 is the default value), 3) an optional <code>limit</code> indicating the maximum number of solutions to be retrieved (positive integer, default is 1), and 4) an <code>output</code> parameter. An answer to a query posed by a GET request is inferred from the combination of the contents of the user module and the RDF database. Note that the session database is not involved here. For queries involving the session database, use the <a href="/www/doc/sessionDB/index.html" target="_top">SessionDB API.</a></p>


<a name="sessiondb"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/session/db API</h3>

<p>A PUT or a POST adds Prolog facts or rules to the session database. The only difference between the two is that a POST appends to the already existing database, whereas a PUT replaces the content of current session database altogether. Starting from an empty database, they have exactly the same effect.</p> 

<p>SWAPP's DELETE operation takes a template parameter specifying the facts and rules to be deleted from the session database. Each fact or rule matching (in the sense of being unifiable with) the template is deleted. The value of the template parameter may also be a <i>list</i> of templates and in that case facts or rules matching any member of this list are deleted. If the template parameter is missing or empty, the whole session database is emptied.</p>

<p>Note that it follows that a PUT /swapp/session/db is equivalent to a DELETE /swapp/session/db followed by a POST /swapp/session/db. </p>

<p>A GET request takes four parameters: 1) one mandatory <code>query</code> parameter specifying the Prolog query that we wish to run, 2) an optional <code>cursor</code> specifying the solution that we are interested in (a nonnegative integer, where 0 indicates the first solution, 1 the second solution, etc., and where 0 is the default value), 3) an optional <code>limit</code> indicating the maximum number of solutions to be retrieved(positive integer, default is 1), and 4) an <code>output</code> parameter. The session database imports ("inherits", we might say) all predicates defined in the user module and thus an answer to a query posed by a GET request is inferred from the combination of the contents of the RDF database, the user module and the session database. </p>


<a name="sessioneq"></a>
<h3>The /swapp/session/eq API</h3>

<p>The main purpose of SWAPP's session event queues and the associated API to /swapp/session/eq is to add a little "server push" capability to the platform, for the purpose of monitoring what is going on in an application, or whenever other needs for a (simulated) "bidirectional HTTP" arise.</p>

<p>A request of the form PUT /swapp/session/eq creates an event queue associated to the current client session. If such a queue already exists, it is destroyed and a new queue is created. DELETE /swapp/session/eq tries to destroy the queue, and returns an error if it does not exist.</p> 

<p>For sending events to the session event queue, the POST method is used. If the content of the POST is a Prolog term, this term is taken to be the representation of the event to be sent. The content may also be a <i>list</i> of terms and in that case they are all added to the queue, one by one and in the order they are listed. An attempt to send to a non-existing queue returns an error response.</p>

<p>Note that the main purpose of the Explorer's support for <i>sending</i> events to sessions is to aid in testing and experimentation. Normally, the server-side application code is responsible for sending such events (see the predicates in the relevant API).</p>

<p>A client interested in the events generated by the platform should use the GET method in order to poll for them. Two polling methods are supported: long-polling and short-polling (i.e. "ordinary" polling). A template parameter specifies the events to be retrieved from the session event queue. All events matching (in the sense of being unifiable with) the template are retrieved. If the template parameter is missing or empty, all events are retrieved. If the queue does not exist, an error response is returned.</p>

<p>Clients polling for events should be aware of the following: The choice of the long-polling method does not imply that the request is hanging there forever. The (default) time limit is 30 seconds, after which a timeout response is returned. The client then needs to issue another request if polling is to be continued. The choice of this time limit is informed by the document <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-loreto-http-bidirectional-01" target="_top">Best Practices for the Use of Long Polling and Streaming in Bidirectional HTTP</a> and is also dictated by the need to reclaim resources after the end of a session. Perhaps more obviously, after having successfully returned an array of events, it is entirely up to the client to ask for more by issuing another request.</p>


<a name="responseoverview"></a>
<h3>API response overview</h3>
    
<p>JSON is a simple format that defines objects as a list of name/value pairs, arrays as an unbounded sequence of values and a few primitive datatypes: strings, numbers, boolean (true and false) and the constant null. In BNF:</p>

<pre>
Object ::= {} | {Pair, ...}
Pair ::= Name: Value
Name ::= String
Array ::= [] | [Value, ...]
Value ::= String | Number | Object | Array | true | false | null
</pre>

<p>Data encoded as JSON can be read and written by code in a wide range of programming languages. Example uses include transferring data between a server application and a JavaScript (AJAX) client, or acting as a "lingua franca" for communicating rich data with applications in other languages.</p>

<p>Our standard JSON reply upon success of a goal uses this format:</p>

<pre>
{"success": true, 
 "message": "yes",
 "bindings": [{ ... } , ... ],
 "more": ...,
 "cache": ...,
 "time": ...
}
</pre>

<p>And in case of failure:</p>

<pre>
{"success": false, 
 "message": "no",
 "cache": ...,
 "time": ...
}
</pre>

<p>The meanings of the <code>success</code> and <code>message</code> attributes are probably obvious. The value of the <code>more</code> attribute (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) indicates if one may expect more solutions to the query. If <code>true</code>, more solutions <i>may</i> be available, if <code>false</code>, no more solutions exist. The value of <code>cache</code> attribute (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) indicates if the Prolog cache played any role in retrieving the solutions in question. If <code>true</code>, it did, if <code>false</code>, it did not. The value of the <code>time</code> attribute (a float) gives the CPU time in seconds that the server spent on retrieving the solutions.</p>

<p>The value of the <code>bindings</code> attribute is a JSON list of JSON objects, each of which represents a solution to the query in the form of the bindings of its variables. Thus there are at the most as many elements in that list as there are solutions to the query, but no more than that was indicated by the <code>limit</code> request parameter. The exact format of the JSON objects representing the bindings is given in <a href="#prologjsonmapping">Mapping from Prolog terms into JSON</a></p>

<p>SWAPP uses this JSON format even for replies that carry no data, such as updates of Prolog clauses or RDF triples. In those cases, there will not be any bindings, just a success or failure indication. </p>

<pre>
{"success": true, 
 "message": "updated"
}
</pre>

<p>When SWAPP creates replies on the server side it uses the catch/3 predicate to trap Prolog errors and warnings and package them in a JSON envelope.</p>

<pre>
{"error": "...", 
 "message": "..."
}
</pre>

<p>Our standard JSON reply upon retrieval of events uses this format:</p>

<pre>
{"success": true, 
 "events": [{ ... } , ... ]
}
</pre>


<p>These standard formats could be thought of as envelopes which can carry any information between server and client. They are meant to carry application level status information. (HTTP is a level below and it carries its own status information as well as the TCP/IP layer further down below has its own. Each is to be generated and acted upon at its proper level.)</p>

<a name="prologjsonmapping"></a>
<h3>Mapping from Prolog terms into JSON</h3>

<p>In Prolog, solutions to goals are given as <i>bindings</i> which map variable names into Prolog terms. A programmer using SWAPP needs to understand how bindings are converted into JSON. For example, the programmer needs to understand that the second solution to append(Xs, Ys, [a,b,c]) is given by the bindings ['Xs'=[a], 'Ys'=[b,c]] and that these binding can be represented in JSON as {"Xs":["a"], "Ys":["b","c"]}.</p>


<p>SWAPP defines the following mapping between ground Prolog terms and JSON.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Prolog atom is mapped to a JSON string.</li>
<li>A Prolog number is mapped to a JSON number.</li>
<li>A Prolog list is mapped to a JSON array.</li>
<li>The Prolog terms @(true) and @(false) are mapped to the JSON constants true and false, respectively.</li>
<li>The Prolog term @(null) is mapped to the JSON constant null.</li>
<li>A Prolog term json(NameValueList), where NameValueList is a list of Name=Value pairs, is mapped to a JSON object.</li>
<li>Any other complex Prolog term T is mapped to a JSON object of the form {"functor": F, "args": A} where F is a string representing the functor of T and A is the list of JSON values representing T's arguments.</li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>The Prolog term:</p>
<pre>
[foo=[6,3.14,@true,[1,2,f(3)],json([a=json([b=1,c=2])])]]
</pre>
<p>is mapped into the JSON value:</p>
<pre>    
{"foo":[6,3.14,true,[1,2,{"functor":"f","args": [3]}],{"a":{"b":1,"c":2}}]}
</pre>

<a name="alltheway"></a>
<h3>A full GET request example</h3>

<p>Here is a very simple example taking us all the way from a GET request to a JSON response. Assuming the usual definition of <code>member/2</code>, we may be interested in the first and the second solution to the query <code>member(X, [a, f(1), 3])</code>. This is how the request would look like:</p>

<pre>
GET /swapp/session/db?query=member(X, [a, f(1), 3])&amp;cursor=0&amp;limit=2
</pre>

<p>The JSON encoded response would then be:</p>

<pre>
{"success": true, 
 "message": "yes",
 "bindings": [
              {"X":"a"
              },
              {"X":
                 {"functor":"f",
                  "args":[1]
                 }
              } 
             ],
 "more": true,
 "cache": false,
 "time": 0
}
</pre>

<p>Here, the value of the <code>bindings</code> attribute consists of a list with two elements, where the first element represents the first solution and the second element the second solution to the query. The value of the <code>cache</code> attribute means that the Prolog cache was of no help here. This is no surprise, since this is never the case for a query that asks for the first solution to a goal. The value of the <code>more</code> attribute indicates that there might be more solutions available for a value of the <code>cursor</code> parameter which is greater than <code>1</code>. Let us make such a request:</p>

<pre>
GET /swapp/session/db?query=member(X, [a, f(1), 3])&amp;cursor=2&amp;limit=2
</pre>

<p>The JSON encoded response would then be:</p>

<pre>
{"success": true, 
 "message": "yes",
 "bindings": [
              {"X":3
              }
             ],
 "more": false,
 "cache": true,
 "time": 0
}
</pre>

<p>This time the third and last solution was retrieved. (Note that we asked for two solution but got only one.) Here, the value of the <code>more</code> attribute indicates that no more solutions exists, and the value of the <code>cache</code> attribute that the Prolog cache was taken advantage of. The request was able to continue from where the previous request left off. </p>


<a name="authorizationoverview"></a>
<h3>Authorization and access control overview</h3>

<p>
    Access to resources in the platform is controlled using capabilities. By default capabilities are assigned to roles which are identified by URIs. Every store has the following role defined by default:
    
    callable_by(_, admin).   % regardless of goal, admin may call it

There is a special pseudo role called "anonymous" which represents capabilities granted to all users regardless of any specific roles. In SWAPP, this role is

    callable_by(foo(_), _).  % regardless of role, you may call foo/1.

    callable_by(bar(_), user).
    callable_by(bar(_), a).


Users are assigned roles and may have any number of roles. A user has the capabilities of all their assigned roles. For example if a "Power User" role for a store has the "Extended Search" and "Harvest" capabilities and an "Updater" role has the "Full Update" capability then a user with both roles will gain all three capabilities.

Users are defined by the platform level, roles are defined by the store.

By default all SWAPP services are open to access by Anonymous which means that no authentication is required. When a request is made to a service SWAPP will check which roles have that capability. If the Anonymous role does not have the capability then the service will respond to the request with an authentication challenge (or read authentication information if it was present in the original request)

User authentication information is used to determine the identity of the user. The store then looks up the roles for that user and determines if they have the appropriate capability. If so the request is actioned as usual. If not a 403 response is generated. Clients must authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication. 

</p>
<p>
Authorization of an action is performed according to the 
following rules, which are tested in order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If the current  request contains an authorization header
that  specifies a  user and  a password  and if  the access
rights of  this user (regardless of  if he is logged  on or
not)  allows   the  action,   the  action   is  authorized.</li>
<li>If  the user issuing  the request  is logged on  and his
access rights allows the  action, the action is authorized.
In this case there is no need for an authorization header.</li>
<li>If the  access rights of the anonymous  user permits the
action, the action is authorized.</li>
</ol>
